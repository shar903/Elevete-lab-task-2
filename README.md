I started by loading the Titanic dataset to explore who was on board and what kind of data we had.

Then I checked the size of the dataset the types of each column and got a general sense of the numbers.

I noticed some columns had missing information—like age, cabin, and where some passengers boarded.

To get a feel for the data, we looked at simple charts showing survival counts, passenger classes, genders, and ages.

I dug a bit deeper to see how survival rates differed between men and women, and across passenger classes.

Age distribution gave  insight into who was traveling—lots of young adults, but a wide range overall.

A heatmap helped to spot which features were most related to survival—fare and class stood out.

We also used boxplots to spot outliers, like a few people who paid very high fares.

From the visuals, it was clear that women and people in first class had a better chance of surviving.

All of this helped us understand the data better and pointed us toward what to clean or transform for modeling.
